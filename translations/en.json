    "description": "InStay is a smart hospitality ecosystem integrating IoT devices, Smart TV, and a remote-control system to enhance the guest experience and streamline property management. Designed for both tenants and owners, it offers intuitive control, energy efficiency, and secure device management within short-term rentals.",
    "problem": "Guests face difficulty adjusting lighting and climate, finding essential information, and adapting to unfamiliar systems. Owners deal with wasted energy, device misuse, and limited control over property resources. InStay needed a cohesive, user-friendly solution that works seamlessly across devices while maintaining security and brand identity.",
    "solution": "We designed a connected ecosystem uniting Smart TV, IoT devices, and a dedicated remote within a single interface. The Smart TV serves as an intuitive hub for tenants, while owners manage and monitor via an app. Through iterative prototypes, we refined clarity, reduced clicks, and maintained a sense of hospitality. The final UI features a minimal aesthetic, clear iconography, and a soft palette that conveys trust, innovation, and simplicity.",

Haptics build body awareness while the app tunes music and vibrations to intensity and goals.

    "description": "Capsound is a customizable keyboard platform that allows users to design, assemble, and upgrade their own keyboards. Instead of purchasing a fixed, pre-built product, customers can select individual components—cases, keycaps, switches, and PCBs—to create a setup tailored to their preferences. By focusing on modularity, reusability, and recycling, Capsound promotes a circular economy model that reduces waste and extends the lifespan of every keyboard.",
    "problem": "Most keyboards on the market are mass-produced with fixed designs, limiting personalisation and often forcing users to compromise on aesthetics, feel, or ergonomics. When a single component breaks or becomes outdated, the entire keyboard is often discarded, generating unnecessary waste. Enthusiasts who wish to build their own keyboards face fragmented sourcing, higher costs, and a lack of beginner-friendly guidance. A unified, sustainable, and accessible solution was needed.",
    "solution": "Capsound offers a centralised shop where users can purchase compatible keyboard components individually or as part of curated build kits. The platform’s modular system enables customers to repair, upgrade, or fully redesign their keyboards without replacing the entire product. By integrating recycling programs for old parts and offering educational resources for first-time builders, Capsound makes mechanical keyboard customisation both sustainable and accessible. This approach reduces material waste while empowering users to create a product that reflects their exact needs and style.",

High‑res renders and interactive previews make designs tangible, blending the excitement of personalization with practical, sustainable shopping."
