    "description": "InStay is a smart hospitality ecosystem integrating IoT devices, Smart TV, and a remote-control system to enhance the guest experience and streamline property management. Designed for both tenants and owners, it offers intuitive control, energy efficiency, and secure device management within short-term rentals.",
    "problem": "Guests face difficulty adjusting lighting and climate, finding essential information, and adapting to unfamiliar systems. Owners deal with wasted energy, device misuse, and limited control over property resources. InStay needed a cohesive, user-friendly solution that works seamlessly across devices while maintaining security and brand identity.",
    "solution": "We designed a connected ecosystem uniting Smart TV, IoT devices, and a dedicated remote within a single interface. The Smart TV serves as an intuitive hub for tenants, while owners manage and monitor via an app. Through iterative prototypes, we refined clarity, reduced clicks, and maintained a sense of hospitality. The final UI features a minimal aesthetic, clear iconography, and a soft palette that conveys trust, innovation, and simplicity.",

    "description": "Capsound is a customizable keyboard platform that allows users to design, assemble, and upgrade their own keyboards. Instead of purchasing a fixed, pre-built product, customers can select individual components cases, keycaps, switches, and PCBs to create a setup tailored to their preferences. By focusing on modularity, reusability, and recycling, Capsound promotes a circular economy model that reduces waste and extends the lifespan of every keyboard.",
    "problem": "Most keyboards on the market are mass-produced with fixed designs, limiting personalisation and often forcing users to compromise on aesthetics, feel, or ergonomics. When a single component breaks or becomes outdated, the entire keyboard is often discarded, generating unnecessary waste. Enthusiasts who wish to build their own keyboards face fragmented sourcing, higher costs, and a lack of beginner-friendly guidance. A unified, sustainable, and accessible solution was needed.",
    "solution": "Capsound is a centralised platform where users can buy compatible keyboard components individually or as curated build kits. Its modular system allows customers to repair, upgrade, or redesign their keyboards without replacing the whole product. With recycling programs for old parts and educational resources for beginners, Capsound makes mechanical keyboard customisation sustainable and accessible reducing waste while helping users create keyboards tailored to their needs and style.",
