    "description": "Capsound is a customizable keyboard platform that allows users to design, assemble, and upgrade their own keyboards. Instead of purchasing a fixed, pre-built product, customers can select individual components cases, keycaps, switches, and PCBs to create a setup tailored to their preferences. By focusing on modularity, reusability, and recycling, Capsound promotes a circular economy model that reduces waste and extends the lifespan of every keyboard.",
    "problem": "Most keyboards on the market are mass-produced with fixed designs, limiting personalisation and often forcing users to compromise on aesthetics, feel, or ergonomics. When a single component breaks or becomes outdated, the entire keyboard is often discarded, generating unnecessary waste. Enthusiasts who wish to build their own keyboards face fragmented sourcing, higher costs, and a lack of beginner-friendly guidance. A unified, sustainable, and accessible solution was needed.",
    "solution": "Capsound is a centralised platform where users can buy compatible keyboard components individually or as curated build kits. Its modular system allows customers to repair, upgrade, or redesign their keyboards without replacing the whole product. With recycling programs for old parts and educational resources for beginners, Capsound makes mechanical keyboard customisation sustainable and accessible reducing waste while helping users create keyboards tailored to their needs and style.",
